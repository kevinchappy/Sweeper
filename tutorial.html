            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <p>Minesweeper is a game with clickable tiles, where some of these tiles have mines hidden behind them. The
                goal is to reveal all tiles while avoiding the mines. Importantly, your focus should be on trying to
                deduce
                where mines are using logic, not by guessing.</p>

            <h2>The Controls</h2>
            <p>The basic controls are:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Left Click</strong></dt>
                <dd>Reveals a tile. If the tile has a mine you lose.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Right Click</strong></dt>
                <dd>Places a flag on a tile that you think contains a mine. Alternatively, toggle flag placement mode
                    with the flag button at the bottom of the screen if your device does not have a right click button
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The Numbers</h2>
            <div class="clear">
                <p class="float-left">When you reveal a tile without a mine you might see a number displayed. This
                    number
                    signifies the amount of
                    mines adjacent to the revealed tile. You can use this information to deduce where mines are located.
                    For example, consider the image to the right. The flagged tile must have a mine since it is the only
                    unrevealed tile next to the <strong>1</strong> tile. Also, there must be two other mines in the
                    un-clicked tiles to the left because of the adjacent <strong>3</strong> tile.</p>
